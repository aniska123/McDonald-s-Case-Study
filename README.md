Run K-Means Clustering:

Implemented k-means clustering with the chosen number of clusters.
Analyzed cluster centroids to understand the characteristics of each segment.
Analyze and Visualize Results:

Provided insights into customer segments and visualized the clustering results.
Used stability analysis to validate the robustness of the segmentation.
Report Findings:

Summarized insights and recommendations based on the segmentation results.
